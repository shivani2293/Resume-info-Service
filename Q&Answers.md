Q1) How would you test this utility?

    To test this utility, we would need to create a test suite to verify the functionality of each API. This should include unit testing, integration testing, and end-to-end testing. 

    1) Unit tests would be used to verify each individual function of the API works as expected. This could include verifying the response codes, the format of the response body, and the data that is returned from the API.

    2) Integration tests would be used to verify the integration between the APIs is working as expected. The goal of integration testing is to make sure that different parts of the software system are able to communicate and exchange data with each other correctly. Integration testing also verifies that the system meets its requirements and performs as expected.

    3) End-to-end tests would be used to verify the complete flow of the application is working as expected. This could include verifying the data is stored in the database correctly, the response codes are correct, and the data is returned as expected.

Q2) What are the problems associated with such a service when the Scale becomes very large?

    - Performance issues due to increased workload and larger data sets
    - Security concerns, such as access control, authentication, and authorization
    - Increased data storage needs, as more data is generated and stored

Q3) How do you plan the architecture for such situations and make it easy to troubleshoot as well
    when Production issue occurs?

    To address these problems, an effective architecture must be established that is easy to troubleshoot and maintain. This includes: 
    - Designing the system for scalability, utilizing cloud-based services to scale up as needed
    - Optimizing the system for performance, including caching, parallel processing, and data sharding
    - Utilizing secure authentication and authorization protocols
    - Implementing a robust monitoring and logging system to detect and address issues quickly
    - Establishing a backup and disaster recovery plan to prevent data loss in the event of an issue
